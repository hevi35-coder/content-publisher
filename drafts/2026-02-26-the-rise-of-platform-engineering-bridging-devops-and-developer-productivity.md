Platform engineering is having its moment—and for good reason. 🚀 It’s about creating internal platforms that simplify the developer experience, reduce complexity, and boost productivity. In a world where developer cognitive load is at an all-time high, companies are turning to platform engineering to free up developers’ mental bandwidth so they can focus on what they do best: building innovative solutions.

Let’s explore why platform engineering is rising to prominence, how using structured approaches like visual decomposition can help, and how tools like **MandaAct** can play a role in this transformation.

## The Problem: When DevOps Alone Isn’t Enough 🤯

DevOps has revolutionized software delivery, but as companies scale, it’s clear that adopting DevOps practices isn’t enough to guarantee developer productivity. Why? Because managing an ever-growing stack of tools, environments, and workflows can overwhelm developers.

Here’s the kicker: when developers spend more time configuring tools or troubleshooting environments than writing code, innovation stalls. And as complexity grows, so does burnout. Sound familiar?

This is where **platform engineering** comes in. By building streamlined internal platforms tailored to developer needs, platform engineering aims to eliminate friction and bring focus back to coding.

## The Solution: Visualizing the Platform Engineering Workflow 💡

One of the biggest challenges in platform engineering is figuring out where to start. How do you map all the components of an internal developer platform? This is where structured mental models like **visual decomposition** come into play.

A powerful approach is breaking down your platform into smaller, manageable pieces. Think of it as creating a blueprint for your platform: 

- **Core Features**: Modern CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD, API management solutions, and monitoring systems.
- **Developer Needs**: What workflows do developers struggle with most? Where are the bottlenecks?
- **Prioritization**: Which components will have the biggest impact on productivity?

This framework allows teams to focus on the right things at the right time, ensuring alignment with developer needs.

## The Tool: How MandaAct Can Help ✨

Enter **MandaAct**, a 9x9 grid app for iOS that helps you visually organize and plan complex goals. Its structured approach makes it a great fit for mapping out internal developer platforms.

Here’s how you can use it:

1. **Goal Diagnosis**: Start by identifying the primary goal of your platform engineering initiative. For example: "Streamline developer onboarding."
2. **9x9 Grid Breakdown**: Use the app to break this goal into sub-goals (e.g., "Automate environment setups," "Centralize logging").
3. **Sub-goal Decomposition**: For each sub-goal, break things down further into actionable tasks. This ensures no detail is missed.

This structured method keeps your platform engineering efforts aligned and manageable, especially as complexity grows.

## Practical Tips for Getting Started 🔥

Here are three things you can try today to kickstart your platform engineering journey:

1. **Audit Developer Pain Points**: Host a team workshop to identify common frustrations (e.g., slow builds, environment drift).
2. **Prototype a Platform Feature**: Start small—set up a centralized dashboard for monitoring or automate a frequent manual task.
3. **Visualize Your Framework**: Use MandaAct’s 9x9 grid to map out your goals and sub-goals. Seeing it all laid out can provide clarity and direction.

Remember, platform engineering is a marathon, not a sprint. Start with small wins and build from there.
